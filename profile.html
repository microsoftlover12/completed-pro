            <h1>How to Get Motivated Every Day When You Wake Up</h1>

            <p class="text-pro">
                It’s Monday morning. The alarm rings.
                What’s the first thought that comes to mind when you open your eyes?</p>

            <p class="text-pro"> “I really don’t want to go to work today”,
                “I have such a long day ahead, what a dread”, or “Yes! It’s a
                brand new week ahead! Looking forward to getting lots done.”</p>

            <p class="text-pro"> Whatever your response may be, ask yourself this question:

                “What is it that made you feel unmotivated?”
                What was driving you to feel negative or positive about your
                Monday ahead? How to get motivated?</p>

            <h2> Meet Nancy</h2>
            <p class="text-pro">

                I used to have a colleague by the name of Nancy.
                She came to work at the same time every morning, and would</p>
            <p class="text-pro"> leave at 6.30 sharp every evening. Not a minute earlier,
                not a minute later. She was known to be the office
                grinch as she was often grumpy towards everyone, </p>
            <p class="text-pro"> so much so people would avoid her whenever possible. She
                complained about everything under the sun.</p>

            <p class="text-pro"> I had a brief conversation with her one morning in the office
                lounge where we were both getting coffee.
                She told me she had been working with the company for over 20 years! When she told me that,
                I asked her what motivated her to stay on for so long, and her reply was simply</p>
            <p class="text-pro"> “I don’t know. It’s a job that pays the
                bills, and is close to where I live.”
                With that, she walked away and I was left standing alone in the lounge
                with my hot coffee, at a loss for words.</p>

            <p class="text-pro"> How could someone be doing the exact same thing for over 20 years?
                And she clearly doesn’t enjoy her work,
                what with all that complaints and grouchy attitude.</p>
            <p class="text-pro"> So why hasn’t she done anything about it?
            </p>

        <div class="container">
            <h2> The 2 Types of People</h2>
            <p class="text-pro">

                This might be an extreme case, but I’m sure you must know of
                people who have been doing the same thing
                for years and seem to not have any problem staying stagnant.
                Whether it be in their marriage, job, or personal endeavors,
                they seem to be getting along just fine without
                progressing towards anything ‘better’.</p>

            <p class="text-pro"> On the other hand, I’m sure you would also know of individuals
                who focus on the positive, set goals and are constantly pushing themselves
                to greater heights. Be it promotions at work, building a family, celebrating milestones
                in their marriage or relationships,upgrading houses and cars,
                setting up new businesses, or going to school again, these
                individuals seem to constantly progress towards something that improves or enhances their life.
            </p>
            <p class="text-pro">
                Without motivation, you’ll give up after a few failed attempts or even on the first tough challenge that
                comes your way. Or, in the case of Nancy, just remain where you are: unhappy yet not doing anything to
                progress ahead.</p>
            <h2>What is Motivation, Really?</h2>
            <p class="text-pro"> Whether you realize it or not, motivation is a huge force in your life; and it needs to
                be harnessed in order to excel and actually enjoy whatever it is that you’re doing on a daily basis.</p>
            <p class="text-pro"> Unfortunately, many overgeneralize the word motivation. We think of being either
                motivated or demotivated as a simple “yes” or “no” state of being.

                But motivation is not a switch. Motivation is a flow. To feel motivated, you need to dive beyond the
                surface. Just reading a motivational quote, being encouraged by your friends or even mentor won’t help
                you build sustainable motivation in the long run.</p>

            <p class="text-pro"> You can think of the motivation that we want to achieve like the Sun (self-sustaining
                and long lasting), which supplies a constant influx of energy to all life on Earth. Just like the Sun,
                your “motivation engine” has different layers, starting from the core and spreading out to the surface.
                The surface is what you see, but the real process is driven from the core; and that’s the most important
                part… I’ll explain why in a moment.</p>
            <p class="text-pro"> If you can create a self sustaining motivation engine, you’ll not only be able to find
                more meaning and purpose in your life, but you’ll be able to enjoy every minute of what you’re doing,
                which will make your roles and responsibilities less of a chore. Now wouldn’t that be a game changer?</p>

                <p class="text-pro"> Let me help you understand this motivation flow better, by breaking down the Motivation 
                    Engine into 3 parts:
                

                Core – Purpose
                Support – Enablers
                Surface – Acknowledgement
                I’d say we’re most familiar with layers 2 and 3, as we come into direct contact with both of them
                frequently.
