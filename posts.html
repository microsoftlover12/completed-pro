                <br>
                <p>You may see me struggle,
                    but you won't see me fall.
                    Regardless if I'm weak or not,
                    I'm going to stand tall.
                    Everyone says life is easy,
                    but truly living it is not.

                </p>
                <p>Times get hard,
                    people struggle
                    and constantly get put on the spot.
                    I'm going to wear the biggest smile,
                    even though I want to cry.
                    I'm going to fight to live,
                    even though I'm destined to die.

                </p>
                <p>And even though it's hard
                    and I may struggle through it all,
                    you may see me struggle...
                    but you will NEVER see me fall.

                <p>Your future is like a canvas on which each thought you experience leaves its mark. Indeed, the
                    subjects you focus upon becoming the main themes that appear in the picture of your life. You can
                    paint a wonderful future by making purposeful marks, but you do not have to do so simply with your
                    mind in order to attract what you want.</p>

                <p>“Why do you go away? So that you can come back. So that you can see the place you came from with new
                    eyes and extra colors. And the people there see you differently, too. Coming back to where you
                    started is not the same as never leaving.”

                <p>You can’t start the next chapter of your life if you keep rereading the last one.</p>
                <p>This too is one of my favourite moving on quotes. How are you supposed to move ahead if you are stuck
                    on the last chapter of your life? You won’t. Turn the page. Move on. It’s time for you.</p>

                <p>Life is crazy
                    And totally unpredictable...
                    It's going to push you over,
                    Kick you while you're down,
                    And hit you when you try to get back up.
                    Not everything can beat you.
                    Things are going to change you,
                    But you get to choose which ones you let change you.
                    Listen to your heart,
                    Follow your dreams,

                </p>
                <p>And let no one tell you what you're capable of.
                    Push the limits,
                    Bend the rules,
                    And enjoy every minute of it.
                    Laugh at everything.
                    Live for as long as you can.
                    Love all,
                    But trust none.
