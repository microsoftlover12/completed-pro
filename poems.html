                <p>You may see me struggle,
                    but you won't see me fall.
                    Regardless if I'm weak or not,
                    I'm going to stand tall.
                    Everyone says life is easy,
                    but truly living it is not.

                </p>
                <p>Times get hard,
                    people struggle
                    and constantly get put on the spot.
                    I'm going to wear the biggest smile,
                    even though I want to cry.
                    I'm going to fight to live,
                    even though I'm destined to die.

                </p>
                <p>And even though it's hard
                    and I may struggle through it all,
                    you may see me struggle...
                    but you will NEVER see me fall.

                <br>
                <p>Life is crazy
                    And totally unpredictable...
                    It's going to push you over,
                    Kick you while you're down,
                    And hit you when you try to get back up.
                    Not everything can beat you.
                    Things are going to change you,
                    But you get to choose which ones you let change you.
                    Listen to your heart,
                    Follow your dreams,

                </p>
                <p>And let no one tell you what you're capable of.
                    Push the limits,
                    Bend the rules,
                    And enjoy every minute of it.
                    Laugh at everything.
                    Live for as long as you can.
                    Love all,
                    But trust none.
